I'm a computational biologist applying evolutionary theory to cancer sequencing data to learn about how tumors adapt to mutational stress. In particular, my research focuses on the impact of deleterious mutations on cancer progession and the evolutionary mechanisms tumors use to buffer against their mutational load.

Currently, I'm a fourth-year graduate student in the Ecology & Evolution track of the Biology Department at Stanford University, working with [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) and [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/).

### Current Ph.D. work
#### Mutational load in high mutation rate tumors

At the moment, I'm exploring how tumors sucessfully manage their deleterious mutational load to identify new cancer vulnerabilities.

#### Selective interference in cancer 

When multiple beneficial and deleterious mutations are physically linked on the same chromosome, natural selection becomes inefficient at favoring or removing individual mutations through selective interference. We tested how common this phenomenon is in human cancers by measuring how patterns of selection change as tumors accumulate more mutations. Using a combination of evolutionary simulations and observations from empirical cancer sequencing data, we found that negative selection becomes rapidly inefficient in most tumors.

### Previous research 
#### Seasonal adaptation in Drosophila

My previous research was focused on how Drosophila populations rapidly adapt to changing environments. I developed a computational pipeline, [HAF-pipe](https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/9/12/4159/6028100?login=true), that cost-effectively measures allele frequency shifts in evolve-and-resequence experiments by utilizing haplotype information of the initial evolving population.
