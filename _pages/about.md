I'm a computational biologist applying evolutionary theory to cancer sequencing data to learn about how tumors adapt to mutational stress. In particular, my research focuses on the impact of deleterious mutations on cancer progession and the evolutionary mechanisms tumors use to buffer against their mutational load.

Currently, I'm a fourth-year graduate student in the Ecology & Evolution track of the Biology Department at Stanford University, working with [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) and [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/).

__________

#### Selective interference in cancer 

When multiple beneficial and deleterious mutations are physically linked on the same chromosome, natural selection becomes inefficient at favoring or removing individual mutations through selective interference. We tested how common this phenomenon is in human cancers by measuring how patterns of selection change as tumors accumulate more mutations. Using a combination of evolutionary simulations and observation from empirical cancer sequencing data, we found that negative selection, in particular, becomes rapidly inefficient in most tumors.

Currently, I'm exploring how tumors that accumulate deleterious mutations successfully overcome their mutational load.
