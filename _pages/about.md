I'm a computational biologist applying evolutionary theory to cancer sequencing data to learn about how tumors adapt to mutational stress. In particular, my research focuses on the impact of deleterious mutations on cancer progession and the evolutionary mechanisms tumors use to buffer against their mutational load.

Currently, I'm a fourth-year graduate student in the Ecology & Evolution track of the Biology Department at Stanford University, working with [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) and [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu/).
