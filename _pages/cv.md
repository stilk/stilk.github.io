### Education

* Ph.D. in Biology, Stanford University, *2022 (expected)*
* B.S. in Cell and Developmental Biology, UC Santa Barbara, *2014*

### Work experience

* **Graduate Student Researcher, Stanford University** *(2017 - Present)*
  * Created and managed pipelines for interpretation of large genomic datasets in cancer and normal tissues (TCGA, CCLE, GTEX, etc.)
  * Developed a non-parametric null model for calculating dN/dS to quantify patterns of selection in cancer
  * Applied Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to infer parameters in a model of a tumor evolution
  * Utilized mixed effects regression models to quantify expression profiles of tumors

* **Life Science Research Professional 1, Stanford University** *(2014 - 2017)*
  * Familiarity with generating next-generation sequencing data, including multiplexed DNA and RNA-Seq libraries
  * Built bioinformatics pipelines on Linux and HPC clusters (bwa, samtools, GATK, etc)
  * Ran experiments characterizing the mutational spectrum of de novo mutations occurring in D. melanogaster through mutation accumulation experiments 
  * Created a computational tool and shiny app for evolve and re-sequence experiments that utilizes haplotype information to accurately estimate allele frequencies from low coverage sequencing data
